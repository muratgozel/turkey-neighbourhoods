## Using Generated Data
The generated data is available under `data` directory. It's pre-generated and stays up to date by regenerating the data on each month. You can import whichever data you want into your project by just requiring:
```js
// raw json data as fetched
const coreData = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/core/index.json')
// list of cities
const cities = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/cities.json')
// license plates by city name
const cityPlates = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/cityPlates.json')
// districts by city
const districts = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/districts.json')
// neighbourhoods by district and city
const neighbourhoods = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/neighbourhoods.json')
// license plates list
const plates = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/plates.json')
// zip codes
const zipcodes = require('turkey-neighbourhoods/data/extra/zipcodes.json')
```
Or you can require all of it:
```js
const data = require('turkey-neighbourhoods')
// data has core and extra.
```

## About Generators

### Core Generators

New data releases will be patch level updates in terms of semver.

## Data Size Report
